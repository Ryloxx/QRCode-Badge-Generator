# QRCode Badge Generator

At some point in your career you will probably find yourself involved helping
to coordinate a company-sponsored event or a local technical Meetup. It's not
uncommon in these types of gatherings for attendees to want to exchange contact
information between themselves. 

But how to do that? Attendees could always exchange business cards or write
down each others email or social media account names, but that can be slow and
error prone. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to scan a each others badges to
capture this type of information quickly and more dependably? 

If you answered 'Yes!" to this question then QRCode Badge Generator is an
app you will be interested in creating. The objective of this application is
to collect a meeting attendee's name, email address, Twitter, and GitHub 
account names and print a name badge with a QRcode that can be scanned using
a smartphone.
